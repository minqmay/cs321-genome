    file created by GeneBankCreateBTree for sequences specified in a query file

Compiling and running:
  Compiling:
    javac *.java

  Running GeneBankCreateBTree:
    java GeneBankCreateBTree <cache> <degree> <gbk file> <sequence length> [<cache size>] [<debug level>]

    <cache>: 1 to use a cache, 0 to use no cache.
    <degree>: Degree to use for the BTree. If 0, the default degree (optimal for
      block size 4096) is used.
    <gbk file>: .gbk file to create a BTree from.
    <sequence length>: Length of gene sequences to store in the BTree.
    <cache size>: Size of the cache (maximum number of nodes to store).
    <debug level>: 1 to write a dump of the BTree data to a file named "dump". 0
      to not write a dump.

    GeneBankCreateBTree will create a BTree file in the same directory as the
    gbk file with the naming format:
      <gbk filename>.btree.data.<sequence length>.<degree>

  Running GeneBankSearch:
    To run GeneBankSearch you need a finished BTree file as created by
    GeneBankCreateBTree. The sequence length in the BTree should be the same as
    the sequence length you are searching for.

    java GeneBankSearch <cache> <btree file> <query file> [<cache size>] [<debug level>]

    <cache>: 1 to use a cache, 0 to use no cache.
    <btree file>: Filename of the BTree file to search.
    <query file>: Filename of the query file to use.
    <cache size>: Size of the cache (maximum number of nodes to store).
    <debug level>: If included, must be an integer. Currently has no effect.

    GeneBankSearch will print a summary of the search results showing how many
    times each sequence was found.

Explanation of the BTree file format:

    First, the BTree writes its metadata to the disk. This metadata is the 
degree of the BTree, the size of the BTreeNode, and the offset of the root node.
There is a variable in the BTree that keeps track of where to insert which 
increments each time a node is inserted. When each node is written, the BTree 
writes the node's metadata first. The node's metadata is whether or not the node
is a leaf, and its number of keys. Each BTreeNode holds on to a number of data:
a LinkedList of child pointers (offsets in the file), a LinkedList of 
TreeObjects, the offset of the parent and its own offset. The BTree writes the
 node's parent (-1 for root, but it could be anything invalid). Then the BTree
 alternates between writing a child pointer and an object. The first child 
pointer (an int) is written, then the first object is written (the key (a long)
followed by the frequency (an int)), then the second child pointer and the 
second object are written, etc. until the last child pointer is written (All 
internal nodes will have one more child than keys). The BTree just writes 
zeroes in the unused places (although again, it could be any invalid number). 
There are two scenarios to consider when writing the nodes to disk. The first 
scenario is that we are splitting the root. When we split the root we are 
getting three nodes from one node so we create a new node, move the last t-1 
keys to it, move the medium key up to the new root, move children if the old 
root wasn't a leaf node, then write the new node, the new root and the old root 
to disk. The second scenario is that we are splitting a node that is
not the root. We are only creating one new node. The new node gets the split 
node's last t-1 keys. The parent of the split node gets its medium key. We move
children if necessary then write the nodes back.
